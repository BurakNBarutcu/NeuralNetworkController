# Neural Network for System Identification and Control!

In this study mainly focused on system identification of highly non-linear plat models and control the outpurts of these plants for specific inputs. The main purposes of this study is listed below.

* Generating replica of plant models by using neural networks
* Controlling outputs of those models by using simple neural network controllers which are mostly linear.

For simplification the plant model is chosen as permanent magnet electric motor for the training steps and data generation.
